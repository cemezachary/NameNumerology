You're a leader! You have a take-charge attitude and nothing gets in your way. You are independent-minded and you appreciate your individuality. In your hands, information is power; not just a compilation of data held together. You have a sharp mind and with great training, you could become an excellent business owner one day.

However, you should try to get along with others because you'll need people to help you succeed. You may feel angry or frustrated at times, especially when business is moving slower than expected.
