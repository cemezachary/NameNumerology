You're practical approach is the key to getting things done. You're undoubtedly one of the most disciplined people in the room. You consistently put one foot in front of the other in order to finish your assigned tasks. Order and structure is important to you. A career in the military may sound appealing to you.

However, you may lack key social skills. You're quite a hard worker, but you may not be advancing in your career because you have undeveloped interpersonal skills. Once you learn how to be more social, many doors can open up for you.
