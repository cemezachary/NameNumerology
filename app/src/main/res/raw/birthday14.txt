You greatly appreciate the freedom to express yourself. You enjoy having a multitude of options because there are so many wonderful things in the world. It's likely that you will jump from job to job in order to find one that suits you well. Therefore, you're highly adaptable and that helps you keep your head up despite all the changes that will occur.

However, you may crave stimulation and that can lead to unfortunate circumstances. Although you enjoy having options, it's important that you learn to focus; otherwise, you'll waste energy drifting from one thing to the next.
