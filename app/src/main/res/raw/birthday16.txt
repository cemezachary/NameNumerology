Your mind is your greatest tool. You are intellectually and philosophically inclined. You tend not to take things at face value. With you, there's always more under the surface. You're naturally curious and as you explore subjects intellectually, you may find more questions than answers.

However, you must learn to give your mind a break sometimes, or you may overload. It's great that you enjoy your alone time, but you must make room for loved ones to fit into your life. As much as you develop your mind, you must develop your heart as well.
