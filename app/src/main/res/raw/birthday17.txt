You have the potential for great success in business. You have a sharp mind and you can become an excellent leader. You are goal-oriented, ambitious, and focused. Challenges don't scare you as much as they scare other people; you aren't afraid to put in the work needed to succeed at something.

However, you must balance that desire for success with compassion for others, or you may become tyrannical. Understand that you need people in order to succeed so it's important that you treat people with the respect that they deserve. You may be the captain of the ship, but you'll need everyone on board working properly in order to get to your destination on time.
