You have a lot of empathy for humanity. Service to others brings joy into your heart. Even as you walk around, there's something about you that is distinguished. You also tend to be in the right place at the right time. You also possess a broad mind and you should educate yourself on a number of different subjects.

However, you must not let ego take control. You should give to people because you enjoy doing it, not for some ulterior motive. You can become vindictive and cruel if someone has wronged you, but you must learn to not hold on to resentment. Let go of the ill will in your heart so you can provide the best service to those that depend on you.
