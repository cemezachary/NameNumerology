You're sensitive and caring. Your compassion towards others makes you quite endearing. You seem to know how people are feeling before they even speak. You may go out of your way to make sure that people feel comfortable. You should consider going into nursing or any field that allows you to be a caregiver.

However, you should refrain from becoming over-involved in other peoples' lives. Your sensitivity helps you sympathize with people but if you're not careful, people can exploit that quality you have and take advantage of you.
