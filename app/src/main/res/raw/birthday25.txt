Your mind is your greatest asset. You are intellectually and philosophically inclined. You are also quite intuitive. You enjoy intellectual exploration; you're quite comfortable with a book in your hands.

However, you should try being more open to people. You may not be the best in social situations, but some people can be just as fascinating, or even more fascinating than the books you read. You must learn to develop your heart as well as your mind.
