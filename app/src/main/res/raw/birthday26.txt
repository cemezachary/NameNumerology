You are a leader. You have the ability to become excellent in business and management because you're focused on results. You are focused on your goals and you see them through to the very end. A well-developed understanding of human nature will help you tremendously in your business endeavors.

However, you may get frustrated easily. Without an understanding of human nature, you may expect everyone to respond to situations like you would, but that is just not the case. People are different and their motivations are different as well. Once you learn to be patient with people, they will be much more willing to assist you in your endeavors.
