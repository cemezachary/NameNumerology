Service to others brings you joy. Making sure to give back to people is very important to you. You have a lot of compassion for humanity as a whole and philanthropy may be of great interest to you. You have the ability to become someone who inspires so many people. You also may be a late bloomer so it's important to take your time when choosing a profession.

However, you need to learn to forgive others. To become who you can become, it will require you to keep your heart clean by letting go of resentment. By doing so, you can continue to be of great service to humanity.
