You are a caring individual and you're quite sensitive. You are also very intuitive and you seem to know people better than they know themselves. Your highly developed intuition can help you become a great counselor or healer of some kind. People feel comfortable around you because you're so warm and inviting. You're very compassionate and people that know you really appreciate that about you.

However, you must learn to be patient with yourself as you develop. It may take you more time than others to mature, but you need to develop faith in order to become your best self. You tend to wear your heart on a sleeve and because of that fact, you may be more easily hurt than others.
