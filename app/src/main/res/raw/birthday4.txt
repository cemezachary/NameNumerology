You are quite pragmatic. You greatly appreciate order and structure. You may take a steady, consistent approach to your work. A career that requires someone to be good with their hands may suit you. You may hold discipline in high regard and you favor results over public recognition.

However, you may lack social skills. In order to succeed, you're going to need people to help you along the way and learning how to relate to others can only benefit you in the long run.
