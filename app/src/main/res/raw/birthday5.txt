You take your personal freedom quite seriously. You march to the beat of your own drum and other people's opinions don't seem to bother you that much. You're in constant need of change so you may dabble in a lot of different jobs or activities until you find your niche. You may be great at making people feel comfortable around you. It may also be easy for you to adapt to new circumstances.

However, a desire for instant gratification can be your downfall. It's important for you to control your urge for stimulation, whether that be sex, drugs, alcohol, or any other vice. Understand that things take time to develop so try not to make any rash decisions that you may regret later.
