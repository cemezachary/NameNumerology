It's important for you to maintain harmony. You may be a great mediator. Your warm, friendly demeanor is a great asset that others around you greatly appreciate. You are so full of sympathy and you would never hurt anyone on purpose. You also have a strong sense of responsibility and you can be counted on to get work done.

However, you may rely on flattery and when you get criticized, it deeply affects you. You may also be a bad judge of character. Rather than relying on others' opinions so much, you should learn to trust your own mind.
