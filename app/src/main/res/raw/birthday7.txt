You are wise beyond your years. You are quite analytical and you take nothing at face value. Intellectual and spiritual exploration excites you and you may have a peculiar perspective of the world. You question everything. You may feel right at home in academics or any scientific field.

However, you may be a bit of a loner. You do feel deeply, but it may be difficult for you to express your emotions to others. A lot of your problems are probably imagined because you tend to overthink things.
