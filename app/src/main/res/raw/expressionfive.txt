You enjoy having freedom. You appreciate having an abundance of options because it gives you a reason to explore. You're also quite dynamic and highly energetic. You might try a number of different jobs but once you find your calling, you'll surprise your friends and family with the success that you achieve. You change your mind on stances that you previously held, but not without good reason.

However, you must learn to focus your energy. You must learn to be responsible and not spend too much time only being concerned with yourself. If not, you may waste on unproductive tasks that take you away from your true calling.
