You are very worldly. You're very sympathetic and compassionate towards humanity. Your giving nature may lead you towards philanthropic efforts. You probably don't pay much attention to gossip or drama. Even though you may be highly distinguished, you still feel very connected to humankind.

However, you may be somewhat condescending. Also, if you believe that you are the victim of an injustice, you can become vindictive. Therefore, it's important that you learn to forgive. Let go of the things you can't control so that you can focus on providing great service to humanity.
