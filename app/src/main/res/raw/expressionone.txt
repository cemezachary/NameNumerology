You can become a great leader! You have quite a sharp mind and you could be a great businessperson one day. You charge forward on your quest to achieve your goals and obstacles don't stand a chance against you. You are independent-minded and you take your goals very seriously. You don't like to waste time with any abstract ideas that don't bring you closer to achieving your goals.

However, you can be quite demanding. It's important to understand that not everyone possesses the same level of drive that you have so you have to be patient with other people. You can get frustrated when things are moving slowly, but you must learn to be patient because great things take time to manifest.
