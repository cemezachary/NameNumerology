You have a gifted mind. You're quite the intellectual and you're inquisitive by nature. You may enjoy seeking obscure, abstract knowledge and you might have a peculiar perspective of the world. You may be quite spiritual, but not particularly religious. You tend to know something about everything.

However, you can be somewhat aloof. You may have a tendency to get lost in your own mind and neglect the people who truly care for you. You also tend to rationalize things instead of actually experiencing them.
