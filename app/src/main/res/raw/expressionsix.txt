You can be a great mediator and healer. It's important for you to maintain harmony and you'll do what you must to sustain the equilibrium. You have a strong sense of responsibility and people can depend on you to get work done. You are also quite idealistic and trusting. You're also willing to work in the background when it's necessary.

However, you may be a bad judge of character. You may miss some red flags due to your naivety. You may be quite conventional so it's important that you learn to use your own mind instead of relying on others' opinions so much.
