You are a very compassionate individual. You are also quite sympathetic and intuitive. People tend to underestimate your personal power, but you are more resilient than people give you credit for. You are very loyal in your relationships, whether they're professional or personal. That makes you an amazing team player and people admire that about you.

However, you may rely on flattery too much. You expect others to pour into you as much as you pour into them and when they don't, you feel deeply disappointed. You may also lack confidence as well, which could lead to you becoming a doormat for someone who doesn't truly appreciate your value.
