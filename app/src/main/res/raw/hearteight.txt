You have the potential to be very successful. You have a great mind for business and you can become an excellent leader one day. You are ambitious, focused, and goal-oriented. A well-developed understanding of human nature can help you tremendously in your business endeavors.

However, it's important for you to learn how to be patient with people. Not many people possess a similar level of determination as you so you can't expect them to react to situations as you would. Compassion for others is a major part of being a great leader. When people know you care for them, they'll be more inclined to give their best effort to whatever task you give them to do.
