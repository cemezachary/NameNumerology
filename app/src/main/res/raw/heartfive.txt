You are highly adaptable. Change excites you because you get to break from your normal routine. Traveling around the world and engaging with many different kinds of people may sound quite appealing to you. You have an abundance of energy and people around you can feel your passion. You march to the beat of your own drum and there are people that admire that about you.

However, you need to harness your energy, or it can be wasted on unproductive tasks. You must control your urge for stimulation because it can take you far off course. Learning how to focus and stick with an idea until it's finished will benefit you greatly.
