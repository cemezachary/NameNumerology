You have a philanthropic spirit. Giving to others is a great thing to do and you enjoy doing it. You have a lot of compassion for humanity. People gravitate towards you because you're quite understanding and non-judgemental.

However, you must not let your ego get too out of hand because it can get in the way of the great work you're capable of doing. Also, it's important to let things go so that you can be completely focused on providing great services to people.
