You can become a great leader! You charge forward on your quest to achieve your goals and obstacles don't stand a chance against you. You are independent-minded and you're quite ambitious. You also have quite a sharp mind that can be useful in business.

However, you may lack confidence at an early age and you must overcome this in order to become your best self. Once you get over this, you must learn to be more understanding of others. You can become a powerful leader, but you must learn to be patient with people who don't possess the same drive as you.
