You possess a great mind and you're quite intuitive. You are intellectually and spiritually inclined. A career in academia or anything that requires high-level strategy can be a great fit for you. You rarely take anything at face value because it's in your nature to be curious.

However, it's important not to be so consumed by just the intellectual aspects of life. You may be somewhat of a loner so it's important for you to open up to the people that you truly care for. There are a lot of things that need to be experienced by you and it's important to share those experiences with people you care about.
