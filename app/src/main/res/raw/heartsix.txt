You're sympathetic and compassionate. You want there to be harmony in your relationships. You could potentially become a great mediator. It's easy for people to feel comfortable around you because of your gentle nature. You have a strong sense of responsibility and people can depend on you to get things done.

However, you may become too involved in other peoples' lives. You may give great advice, but it's up to the people that received the advice to work it out themselves. You must also avoid becoming a doormat to people that don't appreciate your value.
