You have the potential to become very successful in business. You're goal driven, focused, and ambitious. Setbacks are just experiences that you learn from in order to get stronger. Challenges don't seem to scare you as much as they scare others. You're focused on results and that's a major reason why you can become successful.

Financial stability is a major goal for you because it allows you to have the level of freedom that you desire. It is not an easy path so you must be disciplined, forthright, and wise to accomplish what you set out to achieve. You may come across a lot of hardships during your life, but they're all just tests that you must overcome.

However, you might get frustrated easily. It's important to understand that not everyone possesses the level of drive that you have. Therefore, you must be patient with others in order to develop into a great leader. A well-developed understanding of human nature will help you succeed in your business endeavors.
