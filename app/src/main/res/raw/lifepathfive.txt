You are passionate, dynamic, and highly adaptable. You enjoy having the freedom to explore the options that are available to you. You march to the beat of your own drum and people's opinions don't seem to bother you that much. You tend to do well in social situations and there are people that enjoy your enthusiasm. You might change your mind often, but never without a good reason.

You have a desire to experience life to the fullest degree; you must engage your senses. Since you're so passionate and energetic, you probably don't like being controlled. You're likely to become an entrepreneur or work in an environment that allows you to be flexible. You might engage in different kinds of work for a period of time until you find something that is a great fit for you.

However, you must learn to control your energy. If not, you might waste it by focusing too much on pleasure, as opposed to work. You must understand that most people don't have the same energy that you possess and you have to accept it. You must also become disciplined in order to achieve what you set out to achieve. You might have a myriad of wonderful ideas in your head, but they can only be realized once you buckle down and focus on the ones that matter the most.
