You are worldly and you have a lot of compassion for humanity. Humanitarianism and philanthropy may seem like worthy endeavors to you. It's no surprise that you seem to get along with people quite nicely. Therefore, you're probably the least judgemental person in your circle. You also tend to find yourself in the right place at the right time; the odds tend to be in your favor.

It's important for you to serve people in the best way you can. It's best to inspire others by your example, not just by words. You're also quite charismatic and you would do well in an artistic field. You also have the potential to do well in the business world, but it must be something that you're incredibly passionate about.

However, you must learn to let go. Let go of the past and focus on the present. Your journey is a transformational one and you can only evolve into a better version of yourself once you accept that the past is done and cannot be altered.
