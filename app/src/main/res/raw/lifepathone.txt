You are an innovative, hardworking leader. You possess a take-charge attitude that can be quite inspiring. You're also quite independent-minded and you have a sharp mind that could be great for business. You thrive in competitive environments because they offer you opportunities to show what you're made of.

It's very important for you to continue increasing your skills in whatever profession you have. Being efficient at what it is that you do can foster a great deal of self-confidence. It's also important for you to continue being innovative; a short period of rest is helpful but a lengthy period of stagnation can be detrimental to your innovative spirit.

However, you can become too self-absorbed at times. It's amazing that you're so focused on achievement, but it's important that you consider other people's opinions as well. If not, you may become quite lonely. Not everyone has the energy you have or shares the same viewpoints as you so it's necessary that you take their perspectives into consideration as well.
