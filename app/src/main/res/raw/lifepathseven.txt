Your mind is your greatest gift. You're thoughtful, intuitive, and inquisitive. Intellectual and spiritual exploration may seem quite exciting to you. Due to your inquisitive nature, you rarely take anything at face value. You should consider a career in a field that satisfies your thirst for knowledge.

You may also be quite spiritual. You might also be drawn towards more obscure, abstract knowledge. You have a somewhat peculiar and off-beat perspective of the world. You probably feel like an old soul going about your days in this world. It's important that you balance your analytical side as well as your intuitive side.

However, you may be aloof at times. You have a tendency to overthink things. You might get so lost in your own world, that you neglect those who truly care for you. Although you may appreciate your alone time, it's also important for you to share your time with loved ones as well.
