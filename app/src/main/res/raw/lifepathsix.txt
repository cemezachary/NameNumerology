You are nurturing and you have a lot of compassion for others. Your warm, friendly demeanor is an asset that others can benefit from. People tend to go to you when they need some advice so a career in consulting is something you should consider. You have a strong sense of commitment and you do your best to bring out the best in people. You also have a strong sense of responsibility and people can depend on you to get things done.

If you don't become a parent, you may end up assuming the role of a parent in other ways: friends, co-workers, etc. You're quite idealistic and trusting. You may also value being balanced and harmonious.

However, you must learn to rely on yourself, instead of focusing so much on the opinions of others. You must also refrain from becoming a meddler; becoming too involved in other people's problems will strip you of your balance. It's also important for you to not let people take advantage of you because of your giving nature. Trust your intuition and keep your distance from people that have ulterior motives.
