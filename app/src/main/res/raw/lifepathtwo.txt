You have a compassionate and caring soul. You're more in touch with your emotions than others. You're also quite intuitive and empathetic towards others. You're more resilient than others may give you credit for. You are an amazing team player and your warm demeanor is an asset to those around you.

Working in a group setting may be best for you because you thrive in environments with support and direction. You're also very committed to your personal relationships. You're sensitive, supportive, and dependable. You're detail-oriented and people can depend on you to get the job done. You also have a tendency to do everything for everybody, even when you feel drained.

However, you may depend too much on flattery. You're very giving and it can hurt you deeply when it seems like the people you serve don't reciprocate those feelings. You should resist becoming overly-involved in people's lives because that can be quite draining; some people have no problem dumping their problems on to you and leaving you to deal with it. One of the major lessons you must learn is to rely on yourself for validation, as opposed to seeking it from external sources.
