You greatly appreciate your personal freedom. You're highly adaptable and you enjoy change. It might take you a while to find a profession that works best for you so it's likely that you'll have a lot of different jobs for a period of time. You're a very passionate person and there are a lot of people appreciate the energy you possess. Other people's opinions seem to roll off your back like water and you march to the beat of your own drum.

However, you must learn to control your energy. If not, you might spend too much of your time indulging in activities that are hindrances to your further progression. It takes consistency and focus to manifest what you want into this life so refrain from doing things that may feel good now that you'll regret later.
