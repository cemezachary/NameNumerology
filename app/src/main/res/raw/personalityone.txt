You are a leader! You're strong, determined, and unwavering. You like to take charge and you are very independent. You have quite a sharp mind and you can potentially do great in business. You are a doer; the ultimate pragmatist.

However, you can be quite stubborn and demanding. It's important to understand that not everyone is like you and people respond to pressure in different ways. You must learn to be patient with other people so you can develop into an excellent leader one day.
