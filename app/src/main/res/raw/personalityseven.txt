Your mind is your greatest asset. You are quite inquisitive and you rarely take things at face value. You are also quite intuitive and spiritually inclined. Intellectual and philosophical exploration may seem quite exciting to you. You might enjoy a career in academia, science, or anything that excites your inquisitive nature.

However, you may be a bit of a loner. It's wonderful that you enjoy intellectual exploration, but it's important that you make time for loved ones. You're not on this journey all by yourself and it's important that the people that care for you feel appreciated.
