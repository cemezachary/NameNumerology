You like when there is balance. Harmony is very important to you. You can become a wonderful mediator one day. Your kind, pleasant disposition is so valuable and there are people in the world that can benefit tremendously from your advice. You also have a very strong sense of responsibility and people can depend on you to get things done.

However, criticism may deeply hurt you. Also, you should learn to be a better judge of character. You should learn to trust your own mind, rather than relying on the opinions of others so often.
