You are very compassionate and caring. You're also quite intuitive. You sympathize with people quite easily and you do well in social situations. People tend to underestimate your personal power, but you are actually very resilient. Also, you are very committed in your relationships.

However, you may depend too much on flattery. Your emotions may get the best of you sometimes as well. It's important that you learn how to be a good judge of character so that you avoid becoming loyal to someone that doesn't appreciate your value.
