It’s a whole new year! It’s time to take things up several levels! I’m performing in front of a sold-out crowd at Irving Plaza on
December 31st, 2020! That event is already in motion. I am completely focused on making that a reality and nothing will deter me.
Either this will happen or it will happen. Period. I’m not starting this resolution right now; it has been in the works for months
now and I’m making sure that I bring myself closer to that goal every single day. I can do anything that I set my mind to.
Let’s make it happen.
